# Interactive AI Demo Concepts

Ideas
- Chatbot Simulator: user enters a business query; response shows a mock workflow
- Automation Builder: drag-drop blocks to create an agent; outputs a code snippet
- Personalized ROI Calculator: asks needs; estimates potential savings

Responsible Deployment Checklist
- Privacy: anonymize inputs; no storage without consent; GDPR compliant
- Disclaimers: visible notice "simulated AI, not for production"; prototype data policy
- Explainability: tooltips on rules/decisions; pre-launch bias audit
- Security: rate limit, HTTPS, input validation; monitor hallucinations
- Ethics: fairness tests; accountability log; inclusive design/multi-language
- Deployment: sandbox; usage monitoring; human review of outputs
